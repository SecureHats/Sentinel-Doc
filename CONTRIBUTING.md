# Contributing to the AzSentinelDoc

Because Open Source plays a major part in how products are build,
I see it as a matter of course to give the same effort back to our
community by creating extensible and easy-to-use software.

We welcome contributions from the community and have created some
resources to help you get started extending AzSentinelDoc:
